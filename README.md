In this project, we will use web scraping techniques to collect data from an online furniture stores: Lluesma Muebles (https://www.muebleslluesma.com/). This web store sells Doos Design's and other competitors products. We will use the data to analyze how DOOS Design's products and prices compare to those of its rivals. We will also create visualizations to display the results of the analysis and to provide insights for DOOS Design to improve its market position and increase its sales.

Steps to follow:

- Scrape data from the web, using Python's Beautifulsoup library.
- Manipulate the scraped data, using Python to create tables with relevant columns and values.
- Visualize the data and discover patterns, using Power BI to create interactive charts and dashboards.
- Create a report with clear and concise language to present the results and recommendations.
